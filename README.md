# ATOMPY Python Package

A collection of utility functions to create plots and do analysis.

## Usage

If you don't want to install the package, you can simply download 
`atompy.zip` from the latest
release (see [Release Page](https://github.com/frekm/atompy/releases))
and unpack it into your working directory.

Then you can import just as you import any other Python module.

If you use this method, you'll need to install the dependencies manually,
most notably `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, and `uproot`.
